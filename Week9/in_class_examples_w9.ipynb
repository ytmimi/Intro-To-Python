    "Really everything is an API. It's this top level thing that allows you to interact with some system. The code we write and the code we import is an API. Last week when we were using the requests and BeautifulSoup packages, we were literally using an application programming interface. We didn't need to know anything about the internals of those packages, all we needed to know that when we called ``requests.get`` with some url, that we would receive some data. Similarly, we didn't need to know how the ``find_all`` method was defined on the BeautifulSoup object we instantiated, all we cared about was that we could easily find the HTML elements that we cared about. Both of those packages, and all API's for that matter, expose some top level way to interact with them, and you as the developer don't need to worry about what's going on under the hood."

    "some API's are completely open, which means you can start using them right away without any hassel. Simply make a request to the ``endpoint`` that the API has exposed, and you can immedeatly start receiving data (or utilising the service). Other API's are still publicily available, they just make you go through the extra step of obtaining an ``API Key``, which is unique to your account and is often used to authenticate you with the server, and also rate limit the number of requests you can make. Each API is different, but you'll generally need to pass your API key along with each request that you send, either in the headers of your HTTP reqeust, or as a query parameter to the request.\n",
